# Tale-of-Two-Wastelands
A randomizer for the popular Tale of Two Wastelands mod. Comes with a few extra new worldspace mods that I felt fit into the game snugly and were recommended as a part of the Wasteland Survival Guide modpack, which is the basis for what is getting randomizes. Does not include any faction-specific content mods like the Yet To Be Released Long 15 Expansion or the Nova Arizona mod for compatibility reasons (I mostly don't want to include them because that's a lot of free checks once you fail the respective group's reputation checks, plus I would have to make a lot of new checks in the first place and I CBA to do that.)

## Goals
- Blowing up the Enclave Mobile Base (Fallout 3 main Quest Completion)
- Taking Hoover Dam (Fallout New Vegas main Quest Completion)
- Both Blowing up the Enclave Mobile Base and Taking Hoover Dam (Tale of Two Wastelands Main Quests Completion, longest of the goals by far)
All goals require DLC completions (either 4/8 or 8/8, depending on which goal you choose) and goals for individual games expect you only have the game's check sets on.

## Items
- Town/Settlement Unlocks for both games
- New Worldspace Mod Unlocks for both games
- Main Quest Unlocks for both games
- Union Station Unlock (TTW Exclusive!)
- Fallout New Vegas Companion Unlocks
- DLC Unlocks for both games
- Fallout 3 Non-Town Area Unlocks (just so a few quests don't become in-logic quite so fast)

## Checks
- Completing the various Side-Quests in both games
- Completing Modded Quests
- Completing DLC Quests
- Killing Specific Bosses in Dead Money Tweaks
- Visiting the Dead Money Tweaks-specific areas and clearing them out
- Finding all the Item Codes from Dead Money and Dead Money Tweaks
- Collecting all the collectables from Operation Anchorage and Anchorage Gameplay Expansion
- Defeating all the Anchorage Gameplay Expansion Security Teams
- Opening all 10 safes that come with the A Trail of Crumbs mod
- Completing Unmarked Quests from both games
